/*
Problem Statement:
Write a function that converts a given non-negative integer n into its binary representation without using built-in
functions like .toBinaryString()
 */

/*
Here's a concise version for your notes:

### Steps to Convert Integer to Binary:
1. Divide the number by 2.
2. Record the remainder (0 or 1).
3. Divide the quotient by 2 again, recording the remainder.
4. Repeat until the quotient is 0.
5. Read the remainders in reverse order.

### Example: Convert 10 to Binary:
- 10 รท 2 = 5, remainder = 0
- 5 รท 2 = 2, remainder = 1
- 2 รท 2 = 1, remainder = 0
- 1 รท 2 = 0, remainder = 1

**Binary: 1010**
